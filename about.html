      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This project was made as part of a web development assignment. I wanted to pick a topic thatâ€™s not too standard, so I went with tribal rituals â€” something interesting and unique. The idea was to build a site where users can interact with a list: add, search, and delete rituals using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is used to build the basic layout and structure of the pages</li>
        <li>CSS makes everything look nice and uses Flexbox for arranging things</li>
        <li>JavaScript controls how rituals are shown, added, searched, and deleted</li>
        <li>The list is saved in <strong>localStorage</strong>, so it's still there after reloading</li>
        <li>There's a small ritual <strong>counter</strong> that updates automatically</li>
        <li><strong>Live search</strong> filters the list as you type â€” no need to press anything</li>
        <li>A simple <strong>confirm window</strong> appears before removing an item</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h2>Designer</h2>
      <p>This website was created by Bohdan Husiev. I tried to make something simple but functional, with a topic that stands out.</p>
